### The Problem
* Solving Customer churn
  * A fictious dataset about churn from a telecom provider(Databel)
  * My task: Discover why customers are churning
  * Churn:- The Churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate 
    at which customer stop doing business with an entity
	* Leaky bucket problem
	* Keeping Customers is easier than getting new customers
	* Reducing churn is a priority for many companies
	
### Calculating Churn
* Simplified formula: 
     Churn rate = Customers lost / total number of customers
     Churn rate = 10/100
     10/100 = 10%
* There are multiple ways to calculate churn
    * Varies by industry and revenue model
    * An e-commerce platform could e.g. define a churner as someone who hasnâ€™t made a purchase 
      in the last 12 months

### The Data
*Key characteristics
   * Databel, a fictious Telecom provider
   * One big table containing 29 columns
   *  One row per customer
